== About me
I'm a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. Katherine Driggs-Campbell at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
My research interest is in Human Robot Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, and Control.
My research focus is currently on Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction and Collaborative Manufacturing. \n

I received the B.Eng. degree in Energy and Power Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2017, 
and received the M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University in 2019.
