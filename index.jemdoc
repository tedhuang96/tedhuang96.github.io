== About me
I received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2024,
where I was honored to be supervised by Prof. Katherine Driggs-Campbell. I am also a research scientist at Meta.
I received the M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University in 2019 and 
the B.Eng. degree in Energy and Power Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2017.

My research is focused on building *Human-Centered Embodied AI* to enable robots to safely and efficiently interact with humans and the physical world.
A major challenge to achieve this goal is that existing fully autonomous robots do not have sufficient understanding of human behavior,
and act conservatively with humans around to guarantee safety of humans and themselves, which is at the cost of efficiency.
I develop human-centered autonomy frameworks including human prediction and robot planning with human intent and human trajectory
as interface for robots to achieve challenging human-involved open-world tasks.
My works integrate well-established algorithmic primitives and novel machine learning techniques to offer efficiency improvement under safety guarantees.
My works illustrate generality of Human-Centered Embodied AI across various applications including autonomous driving, crowd navigation,
collaborative manufacturing, and collaborative cooking.

My research areas are Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Human-Robot Interaction.

My Ph.D. thesis: *Bridging Prediction and Planning for Human-Centered Autonomy*.
